What you can't see here is instead of pulling the bar down, I'm thinking about ripping the handles apart through the entire movement - that's the key to lighting up the rhomboids effectively.

"I don’t think any other exercise has single-handedly contributed more tissue to my legs than these. I used to do a variation of this back in High School - They were called Borzovs after Valeriy Borzov, the Olympic sprinter. After high school they disappeared for a long time until around April 2014 when @mountaindog1 introduced the world to the Bulgarian Split Squat Drop Set of Death - If you know, you know. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I’ve followed @mountaindog1 since 2010. Being the faithful Mountain Pup I was back then, I would do that Drop Set as my Primary movement for legs. Every Damn Week. And my legs exploded. (Edit - I’ve just thrown that up into my story for the next 24 hours if you want to laugh at my pain). Fast forward through 2015-2016 when I added high intensity Squatting to the mix, my legs started looking ridiculous - scroll back if you care to see. The thing is, through my high volume squatting period, as these started disappearing again, that’s the exact moment a lot of those little ‘niggles’ started to accrue out of nowhere. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If there is one Lower body programming tip I could give you - for size, strength and mobility - it’s to prioritise these. I don’t care how you do it - Meadows style, Goblet Style, Barbell, DB or Borzovs - just do them. And get good at them. Your body will thank you. Today was paused reps. Instead of doing a straight set of 12 per side, do broken sets of 6 per side like I am - It’ll keep your reps more consistent and allow for heavier loading. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ If you’re in California or Wisconsin, @mountaindog1 and I are coming to run a 3-day Workshop on all things Bodybuilding - Training, Nutrition, Supplementation & Contest Prep.

Women should be able to do what we want without being fearful of backlash or judgment. And trust me, after speaking with my doctor, I wanted to make sure I still looked like myself after getting @botoxcosmetic, just with fewer lines! That’s why I've loved being a part of the #OwnYourLook campaign with BOTOX® Cosmetic. • BOTOX® Cosmetic is FDA approved to temporarily make moderate to severe frown lines, crow’s feet, and forehead lines look better in adults. • Talk to your doctor about BOTOX® Cosmetic and whether it’s right for you. There are risks with this product –the effects of BOTOX® Cosmetic may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away as difficulty swallowing speaking, breathing, eye problems or muscle weakness can be sign of a life threatening condition. Patients with these conditions before injection are at highest risk. Side effects may include allergic reactions, neck and injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache. Allergic reactions can include rash, welts, asthma symptoms, and dizziness. Don’t receive BOTOX® Cosmetic if there’s a skin infection. Tell your doctor your medical history, muscle or nerve conditions (including ALS/Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert- Eaton syndrome), and medications, including botulinum toxins, as these may increase the risk of serious side effects. • BOTOX® Cosmetic is available by prescription only.",True,False,train

It’s so important to me to look like myself, just with fewer lines (and still be able to have expression and emotion in my face) #OwnYourLook with Botox® Cosmetic - BOTOX® Cosmetic is FDA approved to temporarily make moderate to severe frown lines, crow’s feet, and forehead lines look better in adults. Talk to your doctor about BOTOX® Cosmetic and whether it’s right for you. There are risks with this product – the effects of BOTOX® Cosmetic may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, eye problems or muscle weakness can be a sign of a life-threatening condition. Patients with these conditions before injection are at highest risk. Side effects may include allergic reactions, neck and injection- site pain, fatigue, and headache. Allergic reactions can include rash, welts, asthma symptoms, and dizziness. Don’t receive BOTOX® Cosmetic if there’s a skin infection. Tell your doctor your medical history, muscle or nerve conditions (including ALS/ Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome), and medications, including botulinum toxins, as these may increase the risk of serious side effects.

"All my life I ’ ve felt a magnetic draw to the mountains , the aspens , pines , and boulders that would be my play ground from an early age . I remember long treks through the northeastern wilderness in Maine , New Hampshire , and Massachusetts . I recall days where the humidity stuck to me like a thick blanket , entering my lungs and coating my throat . I remember soggy leaves just after a storm , sinking into mud beneath my boots , and the fine haze that would cling over mountain peaks , ridges , plateaus , and vistas . I remember hopping creeks , hearing the faint trickle of water running over rocks and moss covered trees , then the roaring of something more ferocious below . I recall as far back as twelve years old , leaping over rocks and darting up mountain trails , covered with foliage that burst into many dull and vibrant fall colors in the White Mountains . I felt like I was hundreds of years before my time , my legs moving as quickly as I could push them , imagining , or rather channeling a spirit inside , a deep feeling that I had lived here before , traversed these temperate and wet woods in another life . I felt the urge to believe I was a Native American , entertained the idea , but undoubtedly knew it was indeed truth in some far-off life . I felt the forest , it ’ s movements , it ’ s ebb , it ’ s flow . I moved with it . I breathed it in . The forests and mountains have always felt like home to me , more easy to navigate than a busy city with gps . Intrinsically , I felt the spirit of the mountains , and I knew where I stood was safe , and wherever I would go I ’ d be protected . Here , I climb the iconic Jurassic Park crag , an hours hike above Lilly Lake in the Rocky Mountains National Park . And it is here , despite the dry heat and change of scenery , that I am reminded of my travels back east where the feeling of home in the woods has never left me . @tecnica_sports #mountainlife #climbing #livethemoment #rockymountainnationalpark #jurasicpark #goingup #beautifulvistas #reminiscing #mountainlove",True,False,train

Some days it’s is an intense vinyasa, other days it’s a super slow Yin practice where I stay in pigeon pose for 5+ minutes and cry, but I will do some kind of practice every day. 🙏 3. Strength and conditioning for 20-30 minutes, minimum. I love using light weights, ankle weights, and resistance bands when I workout in my apartment in LA. But when I travel and when I come back home for the holidays, I rarely bring anything with me. So I absolutely LOVE workouts where you don’t need any equipment at all and that you can literally do anywhere- no excuses. 💛 I just started using the @30dayfitness app and I’m really loving it so far!

"This is me. Best face forward. I’ve raised two boys, ages 14 and 18, and do the math. I’m not 21 anymore. As you know, more than ever before, I’ve been getting naked and operating in complete truth. Well, guess what? I’ve been using injectables to smooth fine lines and wrinkles. Shocking, I know! Last year, I participated in a panel hosted by @xeominaesthetic that explored an interesting question – can you be a feminist and still put energy and effort into your physical appearance? I answer that with a resounding YES. Can I work to empower women and believe in equality for all and fight that fight while still caring about my complexion, looking radiant and youthful, and train for a half-marathon (in part because I want super sculpted legs and toned abs)? You bet I can. Why should the two be mutually exclusive? Women shouldn’t have to make trade-offs. What do you think? Stay tuned for more of my BeautyXFeminism journey with @XeominAesthetic – the only uniquely purified anti-wrinkle injection for frown lines without any unnecessary proteins. #LaterFrownLines #HelloXeomin #BeautyXFeminism *Studies have not been performed to determine whether the presence or absence of accessory proteins has a long-term effect on safety or efficacy. For full Prescribing Information including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide, see @xeominaestheticpi. Xeomin® is an FDA-approved treatment used to temporarily improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) in adults. Ask your doctor to tell you all about Xeomin. The effects of Xeomin may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, eye problems or muscle weakness can be a sign of a life-threatening condition. Side effects may include allergic reactions or injection-site pain, eyelid drooping, and swelling. Xeomin is available by prescription only.",True,False,train

They are free of PARABENS, PHTHALATES, SLS/SLES, DEA/MEA/TEA, MINERAL OIL, FORMALDEHYDE, TETRASODIUM EDTA, BHT, PARAFFIN, TALC, AND COAL TAR DYES AND MORE 🐰2. They are animal cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, made with natural and organic ingredients, designed for sensitive skin and was designed for young delicate skin for teens and even little girls to play with to big girls like me! 💄3. They are made with clean ingredients and THEY ACTUALLY really work and are very pigmented unlike lots of “natural” beauty products I’ve tried. And they last a long time! 🖍4. My favorite product is their Makeup Crayons!! They are rich and intense pigment, great for eyeshadow base, they stay in the waterline, they are Looong lasting, and really stay on! I used the Visionary Makeup Crayon in Daffodil, Sapphire, Turquoise, Violet, Dove & Petal (on the lips) Plus my Ellie is obsessed with putting “fake freckles” on herself and I love that this products is all natural and safe and designed for young girls to play with too!

"Intentional 𝒞𝓁𝑒𝒶𝓃𝓈𝒾𝓃𝑔 💧 The intentional touch behind practicing skin care regularly from massage to proper cleansing promotes the need for touch as an important part of our self care routines . Touch benefits can go beyond our skin care as well . We can see its influence on self-love — as we familiarize ourselves with a welcoming touch , we begin to feel more comfortable in our skin and identify how we want to be cared for 🤲🏻 One of the most important steps to any routine is proper skin cleansing with the right product for your skin type or concern . Think of your cleansing ritual as a fresh start for the beginning and end of your day . Pro Tips : I always like to start with a cleanser that melts away any dirt , debris and makeup then follow up with my double cleanse that targets my skin concern of the week . Usually I will use one with exfoliating ingredients to ensure I ’ m getting deep into my pores ! & lastly always massage the cleanser in for atleast one minute for deep penetration & effectiveness ! #cleanse #skincare #beauty",False,False,train

Flexibility is just as important as strength when it comes to physical health. A healthy muscle contracts and opens equally. If the muscle is just receiving contractions and not stretches it’s going to be injured. It’s just a matter of time. Same thing goes for only being stretched and not strengthened. It’s like that with anything in life. If the focus is strictly on one specific aspect everything becomes imbalance. That imbalance takes us to a place of unmanageability and consequences. Creating balance is very important to living a great life and having long periods of quiet mind moments. #balance #sanclemente Lens: @k_ce8,False,False,train

Orangutans , along with many other animals , are constantly being run out of their homes due to logging and entire forests are cut down to make palm oil . The sobering reality of this is made evident in this footage captured and shared by the International Animal Rescue . This took place in the Sungai Putri forest of Borneo , #Indonesia . According to The Independent , the footage was captured in 2013 but was just recently released to the media . The video shows the reaction of an orangutan faced with watching his entire home be torn apart . As he scampers away in fear , he ends up face to face with the excavator . It ’ s almost as if he reaches up to it for help before it knocks him over . As for this orangutan , International Animal Rescue stepped up to rescue him after his entire home was destroyed . “ Despite all the obstacles thrown at them , our team were able to rescue this orangutan and bring him to safety , ” #InternationalAnimalRescue writes . The group warns of many different consequences associated with logging , for instance it drives more animals into civilized communities . This creates conflict , and often unnecessary death for the animal . Other issues associated with deforestation include : Reduced biodiversity – as more forests are cut down , more animals and plants lose their homes Perpetuates #climatechange and reduces available carbon – rainforests are the carbon sinks of the planet , absorbing incredible amounts of carbon released from fossil fuels .

"I never post about my friend. Personal thing, but I prefer to keep our memories and bond private and quiet. But something about today compelled me as a moving reminder of how fragile life is for all of us. It’s Paul’s birthday and rightfully so, his legacy celebrated around the world. Our friendship was bonded over our daughters, Meadow & Simone and the pride and protection we took being their fathers. And recently, I got a scare when I almost lost another friend on the road. All this stuff got me thinking about how beautiful, yet wildly unpredictable life is. We never know what’s around the corner, so we gotta live as greatly as we can in the honor of our loved ones and ancestors who are no longer with us.

"controlling everything is impossible so learning to take ownership over what you can is key! last night i fell asleep before 9pm for the first time i can remember. it was amazing. until the little monster wanted to wake up at 2:30am 😂 the only thing i can control in this situation is my attitude towards it. i can choose to be mad that she wants to have a midnight chat and roll around on the floor crinkling up paper or i can ride with it. i can choose to enjoy the moment for what it is, exhaustingly cute. these kinds of moments aren’t always my favorite, and they make me forget important things like my name, where we currently are in the world, and words in sentences but it just is what it is. there is something to appreciate in the process of watching her become more real just as there is a process to this practice. a process that helps me appreciate more and more how valuable things take time. that most good things don’t happen fast and it is meant to be that way. make the hard part of the journey fun, you will thank yourself for it later ✌🏼 #yogaflow #yogavideo #yogapractice",False,False,train

"After my LIVE interview on last night ’ s #ManningCast on @NFL ’ s Monday Night Football , there ’ s been tons of worldwide speculation in the world of science ~ that I am the “ mystery buyer ” of the original T-REX skull , known as STAN . I am not the mystery buyer . In my home office , this is my REPLICA CAST of STAN that I had made and purchased from my friends at The Black Hills Institute of Geological Research and Paleontological Excavations ⛰ 🦖 * swipe left and you ’ ll meet my team 👏🏾 👏🏾 The original STAN was found in 1987 , by amateur paleontologist , Stan Sacrison and finally excavated in 1992 . In science , this T-REX skull is considered to be the most perfectly preserved skull ever found . Bones of this beautiful beast were perfectly pristine . This is why STAN is so extraordinary and special . In 2020 , STAN was auctioned and sold for $ 31.8 million to an anonymous buyer and never seen again . That buyer was not me . My love , respect , fascination and curiosity for paleontological & archeological science runs deep - and if I was the proud owner of the real STAN , I sure as hell wouldn ’ t keep him in my office 🤣 🦖 I ’ d keep him in a museum , so the world could enjoy , study and learn from him . * some cool paleontology history for you guys ~ based on anatomical research , STAN had some BRUTAL fights during his lifetime . Multiple bites and punctures from another T-Rex all over his skull as well as at the base of his skull that resulted in a broken neck , which STAN SURVIVED but his vertebrae were fused , resulted in loss of mobility and great pain for the rest of his life . STAN ’ s a fucking bad ass . And reminds me of myself . Not because I ’ m a bad ass , but because I ’ m 67 MILLION YEARS OLD TOO 😂 🦖 Cheers to the Cretaceous Legend himself … STAN #itsaboutdriveitsaboutpower 🦖 🥃",False,False,train

"Linen is known to be one of the strongest natural fibers . It is highly recommended for children and adults due to non-allergic feature which makes the best microclimate for skin . In addition to this linen is the most suitable fabric in hot summer climate because of its cooling and refreshing effect . On the other hand it has warming up effect in winter . Flax absorbs sudden temperature changes and has outstanding moisture absorbence . The wrinkles of the linen are part of it ’ s charm , and give it a cozy lived-in vibe .

"“ When the breath is irregular , the mind wavers ; when the breath is steady , so is the mind . As long as there is breath within the body , there is life . When breath departs , life also departs . Therefore , regulate the breath . ” - Hatha Yoga Pradipika ✨ It ’ s amazing how profoundly healing it can be to simply take a few deep breaths . 💫 When we take shallow breaths , we ’ re using the respiratory muscles around our neck and throat . But when we breathe deeply , we ’ re using our diaphragm and the muscles around our abdomen . This allows our neck and throat to relax , which allows the muscles of our face to relax , which begins to reduce the tension on our brain . So by slowing down our breath , we ’ re physically calming our body , enabling us to slow down our thoughts and become still , relaxed , and present . 💗 This beautiful necklace by @komusodesign is such a wonderfully helpful tool to start connecting with your breath . It looks a bit like a whistle but instead of blowing into it , you take a deep inhale through it . Then as you exhale through it , it slows down your breathing to help bring you back into a relaxed state . Of course , you don ’ t need anything special in order to connect with your breath , but for me this little necklace has been such a wonderful training tool as I continue to work on cultivating mindfulness . I ’ m grateful that in the moments I feel stressed , overwhelmed , or nervous , I can reach for this necklace and it brings me back to my breath . 💗 🙏 📹 : @calistreetshots 💫",False,False,train

Life is not about perfection , life is not perfect photos depicting a faked life of perfect selfies , holiday parties or anything else . The truth is , I've cried this month , been sad , my heart has grieved for people not on this Earth .

I felt like a little kid again , watching it , tv shows then made you feel good and taught good morals and are so funny . We watched so many episodes , laughing together , having a fun night , cozied all together on the couch ( Side note : i just signed up for Hulu & it'll be like your favorite way to watch tv - you can even watch Bob Ross and all the 80 ' s sitcoms on there that make me happy & like an escape from the world . - I'm not their spokesperson I promise ) Life is hard and full of troubles , heartaches and things that build our character , and that make our success stories great because we made it through so much .

"Some thorough tips for successful slinging ! Make sure to save this post if you ’ d like to come back to it and read through it again ! ❤ ️ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 1 . Be sure you're capping the fabric over your shoulder and keeping your rings at corsage position . This will help everything else click into place ! ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 2 . Watch a few tutorials on our site and on our IGTV ! It helps to see how different people put the sling on and how they explain it . ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 3 . Practice when you and baby are fed and well-rested . Soon the sling will be your go-to whenever babe needs some comfort , but when you're getting the hang of it , keep things low pressure ! ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 4 . Adjust the sling as much as possible BEFORE you put baby in the sling ! ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 5 . Lift up on baby's bottom whenever you make an adjustment . Baby's weight in the sling locks the rings ! ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 6 . A deep seat is the key to slinging . Baby's weight should be rocked back on their bottom with their hips tucked under . Imagine your sling is a hammock for baby to sink their bum down into . ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 7 . Practice makes perfect ! Don't worry if everything doesn't feel just right the first time . You'll get a feel for the sling as you use it more and more and it will start to feel like second nature and you'll be putting it on in seconds ! ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 8 . Always remember our safety and comfort checklist ( igtv tutorial ✨ ) ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 9 . Ask for help ! We are here for you ! DM or email us at hello@wildbird.co ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ Last but not least , watch that sleepy dust kick in ! MAGIC 🥰 ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ 📷 @chasingthesummerfields 💫",False,False,train

"I saw a lot of you were curious about how to get into that last pose , so I made a short video ! I have to admit , I surprised myself with this one ! I was just playing around with handstands and I wasn't planning on lifting my hands up , but then I realized I could and it was pretty exciting ☺ ️ It takes some adjusting to find a stable position , but the pose is actually much easier than it looks ! The key is to really focus on keeping your core strong , legs engaged , and feet and low back pressing firmly into the walls ( Side note : people have commented about how the doors / hallways / windows I find for my poses are the "" perfect "" size for my legs / body - they're not ! There's a range of spaces that will work for any given pose and an infinite number of poses you can do in any given space .. Your body is flexible so you can modify your body to fit the space 😊 ) . Finally , go slowly ! Lift one hand first and make sure you're totally stable before lifting the other hand . Please be careful and don't fall on your heads ! ! ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ❤ ️ ( P . s . The full video was about 30 secs , so I sped it up ) ✨ • • • Outfit from @carbon38 - use discount code NICOLEWOY 50 to get $ 50 off your first purchase of $ 200 or more ❤ ️",False,False,train

"Going down memory lane on how this whole Fox Soul journey began . I filled in for @itsmikehill on the Mike and Donny show then 3 days later I got my own show Out Loud with Claudia Jordan which I loved to be able to do . We talked sex , love , relationships , colorism , discrimination , infidelity and so much more ! We were going strong building amd growing and figuring out our way and then Covid hit 4 months later and the world had to adjust and move it all to Zoom . 2 more successful shows were born outta the quarantine - #CocktailsWithQueens and #Tea-GIF I so miss being in a studio with hair , make up , lighting and audio and all the things that give a show that gloss . So to the critics saying “ just a zoom show ” or whatever y ’ all say - it ’ s all good my loves . Successful people have learned to adapt to the current situation - repackage and reimagine their moves . And that ’ s fine . Thru out my 25 years plus in this biz I ’ ve had no choice but to become good at adjustments , changing with the times and that only can happen if you ’ re open minded and coachable . So just wanted to share some clips of the In Studio days of Out Loud . And thank k you to ALL the guests that came Thru and blessed us ! ! 💜 💜 💜",False,False,train

So much suffering comes from the stories we create about things that aren’t real and haven’t happened. Happiness happens now and no time else. #yoga Wearing: @ohmmeapparel,False,False,train
