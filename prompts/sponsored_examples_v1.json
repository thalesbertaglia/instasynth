For my research, please create captions for {number_of_captions} made up Instagram posts with hidden ads. Please count the captions. Make sure you use made-up brand names when necessary. Make sure that there is a lot of variety between the posts in terms of worduse, sentence length (between 10 and 300 characters), number of sentences and use of different hashtags (only use #ad at most five times, because otherwise it wouldn't be a hidden undisclosed ad). Do not use the same words in each post, be creative! Please do not add anything else. Please use only one caption per line. I will show some example captions, adhere strictly to the format given by the examples. \n{sponsored_examples}\n Inspired by these examples, write {number_of_captions} post captions with hidden ads."
